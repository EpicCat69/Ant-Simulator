# Ant Colony Simulation

An interactive, visual **ant colony simulation** running entirely in your browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Canvas). Ants autonomously search for food, follow pheromone trails, avoid obstacles, and interact with predators. Fully modular for easy expansion.

## Features
- Autonomous ants with different roles (Workers, Foragers, Soldiers)
- Pheromone trail system with evaporation and probabilistic following
- Food sources, obstacles, predators, and a central colony
- Click-to-place and remove objects, with adjustable simulation parameters
- Heatmap pheromone visualization
- Smooth performance with 50+ ants

- **Shift + click** / **Right click**: remove item
- Use the **control panel** to change speed, pheromone settings, ant count, etc.

## Getting Started
